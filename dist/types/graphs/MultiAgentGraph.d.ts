/**
 * MultiAgentGraph extends StandardGraph to support dynamic multi-agent workflows
 * with handoffs, fan-in/fan-out, and other composable patterns.
 *
 * Key behavior:
 * - Agents with ONLY handoff edges: Can dynamically route to any handoff destination
 * - Agents with ONLY direct edges: Always follow their direct edges
 * - Agents with BOTH: Use Command for exclusive routing (handoff OR direct, not both)
 *   - If handoff occurs: Only the handoff destination executes
 *   - If no handoff: Direct edges execute (potentially in parallel)
 *
 * This enables the common pattern where an agent either delegates (handoff)
 * OR continues its workflow (direct edges), but not both simultaneously.
